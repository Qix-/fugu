 \section overview Overview
 
 <b>fg</b> is a system for procedurally generating animated geometric forms in real-time. It is currently under heavy development and as such should not be used at all, by anyone, under any circumstances.

 This documentation contains the c++ API to fg, and should be useful if developing in fg, extending fg, or embedding it within another application. The lua-side documentation for fg/fgv will be available elsewhere (in a non-developer-friendly form).
